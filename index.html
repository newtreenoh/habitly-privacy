## Summary

- Core habit tracking works locally on your device (no sign-in required).
- Optional cloud sync (Pro feature) uses Google Sign-In and Google Firebase services to back up/sync your habit data.
- We do not sell your data.
- We do not use advertising SDKs.
- As of the effective date of this policy, we do not use analytics/tracking SDKs in the current app build.

## Account and Data Deletion

If you used Habitly cloud sync, you can delete your cloud data in-app or request account/data deletion by email.

### In-app cloud backup deletion (Pro)

Habitly includes an in-app option to delete your cloud backup data:

- Open Habitly
- Open the Home screen menu (top-right)
- Tap **Delete cloud backup**

What this does:
- Deletes your synced cloud backup data for the signed-in Habitly cloud sync account
- Signs you out of cloud sync

What this does not do:
- It does not delete local data stored on your device
- It does not delete your Google account itself

### Web request method (email)

If you want us to delete your Habitly cloud-sync account data, email:

**Email:** gpc.immerse077@passinbox.com  
**Subject:** Habitly account/data deletion request

Please include:
- The Google email address used for Habitly cloud sync
- A short request (for example: "Please delete my Habitly cloud sync account and associated cloud data")
- (Optional) Approximate date you used cloud sync

For verified requests, we will delete:
- Habitly cloud sync data associated with your account
- Habitly cloud-sync sign-in/account record used for Habitly cloud sync (where applicable and under our control)

What may not be deleted by us:
- Local data stored on your device (you must delete this in the app, clear app storage, or uninstall)
- Google Play transaction records retained by Google under Google's policies
- Your Google account itself (managed by Google)

Response time:
- We aim to process deletion requests within 7 days.

We may request basic verification to confirm the request is from the account owner.

## Data We Process

### 1) Local habit data (all users)

Stored on your device:
- Habit names
- Habit settings (such as type, color, and options)
- Habit log entries/history

Purpose:
- App functionality (habit tracking)

### 2) Cloud sync data (optional, Pro users only)

If you choose to use cloud sync, Habitly processes:
- Your Google account email address (for sign-in/account identity)
- Your habit data and habit logs (user-generated content)

Purpose:
- App functionality (cloud backup/sync across devices)

### 3) Subscription and entitlement information

Habitly uses Google Play Billing for subscriptions. The app may access purchase/entitlement status to unlock paid features.

Purpose:
- App functionality (subscription access)

## Where Data Is Stored

### On-device (local)

Habitly stores core habit data locally on your Android device.

### Cloud (optional)

If you use cloud sync, your synced data is stored using Google Firebase services for authentication and cloud data storage.

## Third-Party Services

Habitly may use the following Google services for optional features:
- Google Play Billing (subscriptions)
- Google Sign-In / Firebase Authentication (cloud sync sign-in)
- Firebase Firestore (cloud sync storage)

We do not sell personal data to third parties.

## Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data with third parties for advertising or marketing.

Where cloud sync is used, data is processed by service providers (Google/Firebase) only as needed to provide app functionality.

## Security

- Data sent between the app and cloud services is encrypted in transit.
- Core local habit tracking does not require an online account.

## Your Choices and Controls

### Use Habitly without an account

You can use Habitly locally without signing in.

### Optional cloud sync

Cloud sync is optional. If you do not use cloud sync, your habit data remains on your device.

## Data Retention

- Local data remains on your device until you delete it, clear app storage, or uninstall the app.
- Cloud sync data remains until you delete it in-app or request deletion by email.
- We may retain limited records if required by law or to resolve disputes or prevent abuse.

## Children's Privacy

Habitly is not directed to children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we change this policy, we will update this page and revise the effective date.
